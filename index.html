            <p>Parallax is a displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different
                lines of sight, and is measured by the angle or semi-angle of inclination between those two lines. Due
                to foreshortening, nearby objects show a larger parallax than farther objects when observed from
                different positions, so parallax can be used to determine distances.</p>

        <h2>How Parallax Works</h2>
        <p>Parallax also affects optical instruments such as rifle scopes, binoculars, microscopes, and twin-lens reflex
            cameras that view objects from slightly different angles. Many animals, along with humans, have two eyes
            with overlapping visual fields that use parallax to gain depth perception; this process is known as
            stereopsis. In computer vision the effect is used for computer stereo vision, and there is a device called a
            parallax rangefinder that uses it to find range, and in some variations also altitude to a target.</p>
